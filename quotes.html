                <p>This is the true joy of life: the being used up for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clot of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.</p>
                <p>- George Bernard Shaw</p>

                <p>We're not really taught how to recreate constructively. We need to do more than find diversions; we need to restore and expand ourselves. Our idea of relaxing is all too often to plop down in front of the television set and let its pandering idiocy liquefy our brains. Shutting off the thought process is not rejuvenating; the mind is like a car battery-it recharges by running. You may be surprised to find how quickly daily routine and the demands of "just getting by: absorb your waking hours. You may be surprised matters of habit rather than thought and inquiry. You may be surprised to find how quickly you start to see your life in terms of other people's expectations rather than issues. You may be surprised to find out how quickly reading a good book sounds like a luxury.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center">...</p> 
                <p>To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never--in nothing, great or small, large or petty--never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.</p>

                <br>
                <p>I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it difficult to plan the day.</p>
                <p>- E.B. White</p>

                <p>Change. We don't like it. We fear it, but we can't stop it from coming. We either adapt to change or we get left behind. It hurts to grow, anybody who tells you it doesn't is lying, but here's the truth sometimes the more things change the more they stay the same. And sometimes, oh, sometimes change is good. Sometimes change is everything.<p/>
                <p>â€• Meredith Grey</p>
                <p>Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses â€“ especially learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.</p>
